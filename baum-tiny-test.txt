Dorothy Gale lived on a farm in Kansas , with her Aunt Em and her Uncle Henry .  It was not a big farm , nor a very good one , because sometimes the rain did not come when the crops needed it , and then everything withered and dried up .  Once a cyclone had carried away Uncle Henry's house , so that he was obliged to another ; and as he was a poor man he had to his farm to the money to for the new house .  Then his health became bad and he was too feeble to .  The doctor ordered him to a sea voyage and he went to Australia and took Dorothy with him .  That cost a lot of money , too .
